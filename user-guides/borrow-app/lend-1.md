# Lend

Lenders can earn a fixed rate of return by depositing USDT in the mooncake application.&#x20;

Lenders buy A and B tranches with USDT on the UNIv3 open market. By doing so, they generate fixed rate yield when the tranches are at a discount to the target price of the collateral token. For example, if the lender buys 1 A-tranche for $0.95, and the underlying collateral targets $1, they will  be able to redeem the tranche tokens for $1 at the maturity of the bond, thus earning $0.05 return.&#x20;



## How to Lend USDT

The first action for the user is to specify the amount of USDT they want to lend.

After doing so, they will see several options for Tranche tokens that they can purchase.&#x20;

The user can use this page to determine the tranche token that they want to use to facilitate their loan. Some things that they might consider:

* _Interest_: This is the interest rate that the user can expect to earn, assuming that the tranche tokens are redeemed at par value upon maturity
* _CDR_: This is the current collateralization ratio of the bond. Generally, higher CDR values are safer to loan against because it indicates a larger buffer before tranche tokens begin to lose value.
* _Maturity_: This is the number of days until the bond matures. Maturity is the date upon which the tranche tokens are redeemable for underlying collateral tokens.&#x20;
* _Collateral_: This is the asset that underlies the tranche tokens. The risk profile of the tranche tokens is related to the changes in value of the collateral token.&#x20;



In this case, I will select the A-tranche bond to earn \~1.3% interest
