# Lend

Lenders can earn a fixed rate of return by depositing USDC. 

Lenders buy A and B tranches with USDC on the UNIv3 open market. By doing so, they generate fixed rate yield when the tranches are at a discount to the target price of the collateral token. For example, if the lender buys 1 A-tranche for $0.95, and the underlying collateral targets $1, they will be able to redeem the tranche tokens for $1 at the maturity of the bond, thus earning $0.05 return.
