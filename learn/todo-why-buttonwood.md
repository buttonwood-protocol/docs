# (TODO) Why Buttonwood?

Outline:

1. give background on the current DeFi approach (which is borrowed from TradFi) of collateralization ratios and liquidations
2. Explain why liquidations and collateralization ratios are bad
   1. they are opaque, they make it hard to understand what the total risk of the system is
   2. borrowers are hurt when prices are volatile (and this is crypto we're talking about, it's volatile as hell!)
3. Explain the benefits of a debt-token, how it's not something that's been done in TradFi, and how it enables anyone to "borrow like a king"
4. Enter Buttonwood. Explain the core features of Buttonwood, and how each contributes to a more transparent and healthier debt system
   1. Tranches used to split collateral token into a spectrum of safe but low-yield tokens and risky but high-yield tokens
   2. A debt-token makes it so a user's debt is transferrable, allowing debtors to pay someone to take their debt (a.k.a. re-finance)
5. End with a paragraph concluding what the main takeaways are, with links to more information about the individual features mentioned above
