## `IBondController`



Controller for a ButtonTranche bond system


### `collateralToken() → address` (external)





### `tranches(uint256 i) → contract ITranche token, uint256 ratio` (external)





### `trancheCount() → uint256 count` (external)





### `deposit(uint256 amount)` (external)



Deposit `amount` tokens from `msg.sender`, get tranche tokens in return
Requirements:
 - `msg.sender` must have `approved` `amount` collateral tokens to this contract

### `mature()` (external)



Matures the bond. Disables deposits,
fixes the redemption ratio, and distributes collateral to redemption pools
Requirements:
 - The bond is not already mature
 - One of:
     - `msg.sender` is `owner`
     - `maturityDate` has passed

### `redeemMature(address tranche, uint256 amount)` (external)



Redeems some tranche tokens
Requirements:
 - The bond is mature
 - `msg.sender` owns at least `amount` tranche tokens from address `tranche`
 - `tranche` must be a valid tranche token on this bond

### `redeem(uint256[] amounts)` (external)



Redeems a slice of tranche tokens from all tranches.
 Returns collateral to the user proportionally to the amount of debt they are removing
Requirements
 - The bond is not mature
 - The number of `amounts` is the same as the number of tranches
 - The `amounts` are in equivalent ratio to the tranche order


### `Deposit(address from, uint256 amount)`





### `Mature(address caller)`





### `RedeemMature(address user, address tranche, uint256 amount)`





### `Redeem(address user, uint256[] amounts)`
